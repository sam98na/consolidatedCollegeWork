WORKOUT 1: Analysis of the ibtracs storm dataset

This is the first major project assignment of Fall2019 Stats 133.
Involved is the freeform analysis of the ibtracs 2010-2015 storm data, 
alongside some guided portions.

The filestructure can be explained as follows:
- code: contains the exploratory R script, used to create all of the plots and
	images used in the final report, as well as a text document documenting
	the commands used to create the final cleaned dataset that was used
	in the majority of the project
- data: contains all 6 of the 2010-2015 ibtracs storm data (which were condensed
	into one file using the commands listed in the text document referenced above),
	as well as the condensed file, and the data dictionary, the metadata on the final
	condensed file.
- images: contains all of the plots (in pdf and png form) used in the final report.
- output: contains all of the summaries and the information about the dataframes used
	in the intermediary steps of the process of creating the plots and reference
	dataframes used in the final report.
- report: contains the final Rmd report, alongside the github_document md form.
